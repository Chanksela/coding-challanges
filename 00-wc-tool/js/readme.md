# What I Learned

### The idea of Unix is pretty simple, so it made me return to the basics:

- Started by carefully writing conditions for commands.
- Initially opted for procedural coding, forcing me to think very carefully about each step.
- Engaged more in the practice of pseudo-coding, which proved to be a good habit.
- Learned about the file system (fs) in Node.js, a concept I had not used before.
- Encountered bugs that refreshed my memory about variable scopes, which was a fun challenge.
- Explored simple styling of consoled text in the terminal.
- Dealt with a ridiculous amount of lines for this seemingly easy program, prompting me to contemplate how to effectively divide code into smaller, functional blocks.
