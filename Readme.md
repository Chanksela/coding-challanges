# Coding Challenges

This is my journey to Coding Challenges by John Crickett. For more information about the challenge [click here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/).

## My goal

My goal is to try to solve these challenges with 2 languages: **JavaScript** and **PHP**. The idea is to improve my existing knowledge in these languages and learn new things. Along the way, maybe, I will add one additional language to my arsenal.

## Method

My method is simple:

- Each task will have a separate folder.
- Each task folder will have its own subfolder for the languages in which it is solved.
- Each solution will have a readme file, where I will summarize my journey, write how I solved it, and share what new things I've learned.
